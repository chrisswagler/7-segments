# 7-segments

This project was from a lab in Northeastern's Embedded Design: Enabling Robotics course. The purpose of this lab was to use the DE1-SoC board components with object-oriented design and C++ Makefiles. Particularly, this lab used the LEDs, switches, buttons, and 7-segment displays.

The end objective of the lab was to create a counter that was displayed in binary on the board's 10 LEDs and in decimal on the board's 7-segment displays. This counter was manipulated by giving the four buttons distinct functions: incrementing, decrementing, shifting bits left, shifting bits right, and if multiple buttons were pressed, the counter value would change to reflect the binary value represented by the 10 switches.
